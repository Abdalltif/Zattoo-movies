## Zattoo - Android Code Challenge

We would like you to complete a simple programming task. The goal is to allow you to demonstrate
your best programming practices, habits and your approach to common problems by modifying and
improving an existing working project. The areas of improvement can be architecture, testing, UI,
fixing bugs or any other mistake you find. You are encouraged to finish the task within one week but
that’s only to facilitate, the actual time needed is of course much less.

Feel free to use any libraries that, in your opinion, are appropriate for the task. You can also
change the DI setup, as you want. Please don’t use libraries that solve the whole problem at once,
e.g. download and display the whole list of items based just on a provided url. Remember, we want to
evaluate your coding skills.

The app should continue to:
* Display a list of movies available at movie_offers
* Display the additional data for each movie, available at movie_data
* Have a UI, that displays the parent and child items in a distinguishable manner

The solution needs:
* To contain git commit logs that reflect your progress, you can commit locally without the need to
  push your commits to a remote repository.
* To be provided as a zip archive or you can upload it to a private online repository.
* To compile, run and unit tests run as expected.

When evaluating your solution, we will focus on application architecture, code quality, unit tests,
git commit logs, as well as libraries used. Please add in the readme file any comments that may help
the reviewers understand the solution, or any future improvement points.

Please: 
* do not delete `.git` folder 
* send your solution to android-recruitment@zattoo.com. 

Good luck and happy coding!
